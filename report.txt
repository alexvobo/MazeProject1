Part 1 - Understanding the methods [10 points]:
a) Explain in your report why the first move of the agent for the example search problem from Figure 8 is to the east rather
than the north given that the agent does not know initially which cells are blocked.

    A: The first move of the agent in figure 8 is to the east rather than north because the agent always knows which (unblocked) cell the target is in.
Since E3 is adjacent to the agent initially, is unblocked, and presumably the shortest path to the target, the agent moves there first.

b) This project argues that the agent is guaranteed to reach the target if it is not separated from it by blocked cells. Give a
convincing argument that the agent in finite gridworlds indeed either reaches the target or discovers that this is impossible
in finite time. Prove that the number of moves of the agent until it reaches the target or discovers that this is impossible is
bounded from above by the number of unblocked cells squared.

Part 2 - The Effects of Ties [15 points]: Repeated Forward A* needs to break ties to decide which cell to expand next if
several cells have the same smallest f-value. It can either break ties in favor of cells with smaller g-values or in favor of
cells with larger g-values. Implement and compare both versions of Repeated Forward A* with respect to their runtime or,
equivalently, number of expanded cells. Explain your observations in detail, that is, explain what you observed and give a
reason for the observation.
[Hint: For the implementation part, priorities can be integers rather than pairs of integers. For example, you can use
c × f(s) − g(s) as priorities to break ties in favor of cells with larger g-values, where c is a constant larger than the largest
g-value of any generated cell. For the explanation part, consider which cells both versions of Repeated Forward A* expand
for the example search problem from Figure 9.]
